This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks which run basal friction inversions for Athabasca Glacier in a historical (1960s) geometry and modern (2010s) geometry. 
You will need to download Icepack and its Firedrake dependencies: https://icepack.github.io/install/.
You will need to update the file paths for model inputs to reflect the directory where you download the provided 'Athabasca_Icepack_Inputs' folder.
Good luck and please reach out with questions: dpolashenski2@alaska.edu.
